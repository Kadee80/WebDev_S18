Next week you will be presenting your final project ideas. based on your proposal, I will let you know if the scope of the project is too big, too small, or just right and what needs to be added or focused on.

## Final Project Options:

If you choose this option – you MUST add in enough new features for it to qualify as a secondary substantial project!

* Modify Bootstrap’s CSS and JavaScript enough to make the site look like a custom build. No default bootstrap colors, fonts, etc.

* Site should be a completed site for final, no missing pages.

* Add in some sort of custom javascript, jquery outside of bootstrap defaults. Attempt to implement an external javascript framework.

### All New Website Idea:

Come up with a completely new idea for the final.

* If you use Bootstrap, you must modify Bootstrap’s CSS and JavaScript enough to make the site look like a custom build. No default bootstrap colors, fonts, etc.
