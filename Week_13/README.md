## Presentations

NEXT week you will be presenting your final website projects. Your presentation should cover:

## Documentation

- Blog documentation of your process
- Explanation of some of your source code (not the entire site but sometime you found challenging or interesting you’d like to share)
- Any issues you encountered
- What you learned in order to accomplish your project
- Next steps – if you had more time and more tools, what would you do next?
- Your design and presentation is long part of your grade. I will be looking through your source code on github later this week.

## Source Code on Github and Link to Hosted Site (live on server)

Be sure to have a visible folder labeled midterm in your repository with your source code by THIS COMING FRIDAY. Within your midterm folder, add a README.md file containing a link to the live hosted site, and a second link to your documentation.

You can add links with markdown as follows:
