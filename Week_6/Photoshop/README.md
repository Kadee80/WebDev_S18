# Photoshop Essentials and Image Optimization

Today we are going to go over the 2 or 3 things you absolutely need to know in Photoshop:

* Image Optimization

* Image Cropping

* Image Slicing

## Crop Tool

Sometimes you just get a bunch of stock images, and you need to resize them all to match (for a slideshow or a template maybe). The quick and dirty way to do this is using the crop tool. I recorded a quick screencast of how we will be cropping our images to a square format for a simple portfolio homepage we will be building later.

## Saving Images for the web:

Once we have cropped our images, we need to save them out for the web. Our options are:

GIF – best for small images like logos with very few colors, or animated GIFs
JPEG – best for larger images with many colors
PNG8 –  sometimes better than jpeg for larger images and clearer than a GIF, its always best to compare all formats and choose the best option for image quality and file size balance
PNG24- Use this if you need a transparent background

*When saving out our edited images for the web, we need to make sure we keep the file size down while keeping image integrity.*

## Using Vector Shapes as Clipping Masks

Sometimes, you have an layout in your head, but you are not sure about which images go where. Rather than crop each image with the crop tool one by one, we can use vector shapes to block out our layout. The first video shows how to set up the layout, the second shows how to bring in photos and link/crop them with clipping masks and the vector shapes we created.

## Using Layer Masks to quickly toggle between black and white, and color images:

You’ve probably seen a lot of websites that have black and white images until you hover over them and they transition to a color version of the image. This video will show how to link a layer mask to a photo that is linked to a clipping mask. By doing this, we have both a color and a black and white version of each image without having to duplicate each image and convert them to black and white.

## Using the Slice Tool to name, size, and save multiple images for web at once:

When you get a giant photoshop file from a designer, you probably don’t want to move too many things around. you just want to turn layers on and off and save out images for the web. You might also need exact dimensions of the logo or gallery images they designed for. Using the slice tool, you can quickly:

* Block out several images at once

* Name them (for save for web export)

* Size them (or find out what size you need to make a div)

* Save them all out in multiple formats and quality settings while only going to file> save for web once.

* Honestly, if you think of an effect you want to do in photoshop, take to the GOOGLE and find a video, some of them are really great. Learning Adobe products is a lot easier with video.*
