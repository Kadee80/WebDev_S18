# Reading -

Next week we begin an introduction to Javascript. Although use of JavaScript is not required for your Midterm, those of you who wish to implement it are welcome to. Come to class next week having read the class notes for Week_7.

# HW - Keep working on your midterm sites.

If you have a question, I'm here to help. People who email and schedule a time will have priority over walk ins. I will be posting office hours next week.

Web development is constantly changing. It is a lot of reading docs, and following tutorials and examples as you learn new skills. Here are a few links to some standard tutorials of more complex CSS applications:

If you want to explore various ways to turn an unordered list of links `ul li a` into a navigation bar, [check out these tutorials from W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp)

If you want a pure CSS slider, [check out this tutorial](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/pure-css3-cycling-slideshow/).

If you are looking for a collapsable accordion, [check out this W3 Schools tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp). (This example is more simple than the pure CSS version. It does however, utilize a small amount of JavaScript.)

If you want a tooltip, [check out this W3 schools tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_tooltip.asp).

If you want a pure CSS popup window, [check out this example I wrote](Modal_Window/)

If you are struggling with CSS layouts and responsive media queries, [check out 996 Grid Framework](http://996grid.com/). We will be using it for our quick portfolio example this week!
