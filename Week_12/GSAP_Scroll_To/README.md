# Scrollto Plugin – Elevator animation/nav example:

This example will be using a lot of jQuery, GSAP’s TweenLite, EasePack, and ScrollTo plugins.

We should wrap all of our code in a document.ready function to ensure nothing executes before everything has loaded on our page:

```jquery
$(document).ready(function() {

});
```

This example will also be using jQuery’s [.offset()](https://api.jquery.com/offset/) and a [custom HTML5 data attribute](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_data.asp). You can read up on these further in the links above.
