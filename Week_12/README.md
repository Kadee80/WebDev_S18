# HW Week 13

Keep working on your final projects.

[Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) on your computers before Monday's class. 
[Install SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install)

*Spoiler, we are going to take a look at SASS*

###Install SASS using command line:

```bash
gem install sass
```
If  it does not install, and you receive an error you need to install as admin on your computer. `sudo` will always prompt you for your computers password:
```bash
sudo gem install sass
```
Check your version and confirm SASS is installed:
```bash
sass -v
```
