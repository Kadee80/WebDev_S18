## Course Pre-requisites

Basic computer knowledge. Basic familiarity with any programming/scripting language is preferred but no required.

## Course Description

In this course, students focus on client-side programming. Assignments are arranged in sequence to enable the production of a website of professional quality in design and production. This studio stresses interactivity, usability, and the quality and appropriateness of look and feel.

This course will provide a basic understanding of the methods and techniques of developing a simple to moderately complex web site. Using the current standard web page language, students will be instructed on creating and maintaining a simple web site using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and various external libraries.

### Program Learning Objectives

**Students will:**

1 – Students will develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
	Students will develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.

2 – Students will develop technical skills to realize their ideas.
Students will understand and utilize tools and technology, while adapting to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn.
	Students will be able to integrate/interface different technologies within a technological ecosystem.

3 – Students will develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.

4 – Students will gain knowledge of professional practices and organizations by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.

5 – Students will develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.



Learning Outcomes to be Assessed:
2 – Students will develop technical skills to realize their ideas.
Students will understand and utilize tools and technology, while adapting to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn.
Students will be able to integrate/interface different technologies within a technological ecosystem.


### Course Objectives**

* User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX)
* HTML5 / CSS3
* HTML/CSS/SASS Frameworks: Bootstrap and One We Build From Scratch
* The Responsive Web (flexible media & media queries)
* Javascript/Javascript Libraries


### Course Structure

Class time will be spent as a combination of lecture, review, and in class exercises. Homework will consist of online tutorials as well as weekly projects that build on each week’s topics of discussion.

It is expected that everyone in the class will create and maintain a blog for their assignments.

#### Readings

There is no required textbook for this course, however students will be required to complete various W3 Schools tutorials between classes.

#### Laptop Usage During Class

I love having WiFi available and I think it is a valuable tool for use in the classroom. Unfortunately, it can very easily be a distraction as well. We are going to be exploring a variety of models for live interaction online and therefore laptops will prove very useful. We should though be courteous to one another and when we have outside guests, during discussion or student presentations laptops use should be curtailed.

## Grading

Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:

**Regular Assignments 20%**

We will have weekly assignments that are relevant to material from the previous class.

**Mid-Term Project 25%**

The midterm assignment will be a project that demonstrates a working knowledge of HTML and CSS elements.

**Participation and Attendance 25%**

Attendance is *mandatory*. Please inform me via email if you are going to miss a class. Showing up late for class or an excessive number of absences will adversely affect your grade. This class will be participatory, you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and participate with their projects. This (along with attendance) is 25% of your overall grade.

**PLEASE NOTE: 3 unexcused absences will result in your grade dropping 5%**

**Final Project 25%**

Class will culminate with final projects. It is expected that these will be both technology and content driven. The final project will be built over the course of several weeks.

**Documentation 5%**
