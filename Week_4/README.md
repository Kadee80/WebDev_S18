# HW - Due Monday, Week 5

Next week you will be presenting you midterm project proposals to your classmates. Plan on showing a blog post and optional slideshow (or combination of the 2) describing a simple multipage (minimum of 3 pages) website. Blog post / slideshow should include:

* concept|theme of site (not just random images and links that show skill)
* site map  and wireframes
* an existing website you drew inspiration from (bonus points for pinterest collection or mood board)
* concepts|skills we have covered that you will use to build your site
* concepts|skills you need to still learn to complete the project

## Examples
