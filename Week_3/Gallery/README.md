# Box Model and Simple Layouts Using CSS

Today we are going to make a single page image gallery about NYC.

## Box Model and Pixel Math

First let’s do a little math to make sure we can fit 3 images perfectly spaced within a 900px container div that is centered on the page.

We are going to use margins for transparent space between each image container, and borders to create the “polaroid” uneven border around the image.

So if we are trying to fit 3 polaroids perfectly within our 900px container, what is the width of each div?

```
900px/3 = 300px 
(remember this includes margins and borders!)
```

So if we have 300px to work with, we need to first subtract our margins from either side:
```
300px - 40px = 260px 
(remember to subtract 20px twice for the right margin and the left margin)
```

OK. We are down to 260px to work with. But what about the border? Remember, unlike margins, borders and padding both add dimension to an element’s width.
```
260px - 20px = 240px
(remember we have 10px on the left AND right so we need to subtract 20px, not 10px)
```
### In Class Exercise:
What if our container div is 1000px wide and we want to fit 4 images per row with a margin of 10px on each side and a border of 10px?

```
.container{
  width: 1000px;
  /*set the top/bottom margins to 0, and the left/right to auto to center the container in the page*/
  margin:0 auto;
}

.polaroid{
  margin:10px;
  border:10px;
  width: ??px;
}
```

## Float, Clear and Inline Block

* Block elements want to take up the entire width of the page/containing element.

* Inline elements will keep stacking on the right as long as there is enough space.

[W3 inline vs block elements](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp)

```
.myInlineElement{
  display:inline;
}
```
```
.myBlockElement{
  display:block;
}
```
```
.myInlineBlockElement{
  display:inline-block;
}
```

Wait! What is inline-block? It is kind of the best of both worlds. We still need to define dimensions of our element in the CSS but we can stack elements without that pesky clearing nonsense!

## Positioning Elements:

Sometimes we need a little more control over where an element is positioned. Sometimes margins, padding, and layout grids just are not enough. We can do this using the CSS position property.

### Relative Fixed and Absolute:

Honestly, can’t say it any better than w3Schools. Also, CSS is a big crazy monster, and we would all get used to looking through documentation to figure out how to do exactly what we are trying to do. Here is a reference link explaining positioning:

### Relative inside Absolute and Absolute inside Relative:
Sometimes we need to position elements within elements. When we do this, we need to make sure the parent element has a position defined as well.
