# HW - Due Monday, Week 4

By now we should have gotten the hang of some simple git and GitHub terminal commands. By Monday of next week. Be sure to have posted folders with all HW assignments to this point to your HW repository. For example, HW assigned week1 should be posted to a Week_1/ folder in your repo.

Once you have your server space set up, be sure to create a README.md file in each weeks folder and post a link to your blog documentation for the corresponding code you have pushed to that folder.

This week we will build upon our recipe website/page. Using the entry level CSS we covered this week, mark up your recipe page (you should have a pure html markup already from last weeks assignment!) to have a header, footer, menu and side column. Play around with fonts, colors, margins, padding, floats, and any other CSS properties we have covered so far.

If you are still unfamiliar with git, practice! [Here is a helpful tutorial](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) that explains what git does and how to use it with github.
