# HW Week 10 - Due Monday of Week 11

Add a new JavaScript function to your Midterm Project. 

Keep in mind you will have to write a function from scratch. 

If you can not think of an application for your Midterm, you have to option to write a html/js page from scratch to accomplish your goal. If you write a new page, dont worry about CSS, just JS DOM interactivity/manipulation. 

Feel free to be silly with your concept.

Take a risk and try something hard rather than something safe. If you attempt something and are unsuccessful, that is fine as long as you document the process and present questions that arose.
