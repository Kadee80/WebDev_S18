# HW - Due Week 8

Finish your midterm sites. You will be presenting Week 8. *We do not have class next week due to Spring Break.*

## In order for your Midterm to accepted as complete you will need to provide the following:

1. In Class Presentation
2. Midterm project code in Midterm/ folder on your GitHub repository
3. Documentation with either blog or README.md file within your Midterm/ folder on GitHub
4. Your code must be hosted on your server. You must provide a link to your live site in your GitHub Midterm/ folder and documentation.

Your presentation will take 7 minutes including time for questions/comments. You should include the following in your presentation:

* Blog documentation of your process
* Explanation of some of your source code (not the entire site but sometime you found challenging or interesting you’d like to share)
* Any issues you encountered
* What you learned in order to accomplish your project
* Next steps –  if you had more time and more tools, what would you do next?

I will be handing out comment sheets for each student to fill out for each presentation. Every student should fill out a suggestion, question, compliment to give to the presenter anonymously. In addition to this, you will all be assigned another student to make a verbal comment/suggestion to after they are done presenting. Part of working on a web development team is critiquing and conversing.
