### HOMEWORK:

[Read Through This Git Tutorial](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

* [Email Me Your GitHub HW Repo Link](mailto:kaa328@nyu.edu)

* Make sure you have all software set up for next class. We won’t be using photoshop for a few weeks but please inquire about the student discounts.

* Make a new folder in your HW repo called Week_1. In that folder, save .txt or .md file with  your favorite cooking recipe. We will be using that to format some HTML next week. Use `git add` `git commit` and `git push` to upload these folders and files to Github, just like we did in class today.

* Get your blog/server space set up. I understand it make take a while to get an appointment. In the meantime, you will submit your assignments by adding them to your GitHub Repo.

* You can receive web server space from IDM’s Technology Manager, Elton Kwok, MAGNET 883 or if you already have your own that works too. Please [email him](mailto:eltonkwok@nyu.edu) for an appointment (plan on it taking 30 minutes).

* IDM’s FTP server info: http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu (Use active mode)
If you have your own server space set up already that is also ok.

**Documentation is 5% of your grade at IDM.**
