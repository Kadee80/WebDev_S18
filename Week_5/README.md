# Midterm Proposal Presentation Schedule

### Midterm Project is 25% of your final grade.

Consider it like a 3 week homework assignment. Midterm Presentations will take place Week 8. (The week after spring break. Week of March 20th). I have moved the midterm back due based on class progress. I believe the class will benefit from the extra time to work on the assignment as well as some more in depth in class demonstrations of more complex concepts.

Today you will be presenting your midterm proposals to your classmates. Please be respectful of your fellow students and keep your laptops closed while listening to presentations. Each presentation should take 3-5 minutes including questions and comments. Presentations will be timed in order to accomodate all studented within one class period.

** All proposals are due the first class of Week 5. We will be using a simple javascript function to shuffle your names and choose presentation order at the beginning of class so be prepared! **

##PSA:
*Week 6 we will be learning image optimization in Photoshop. Please have at the very least a trail version of Adobe Photoshop CC installed on your machines before class next week.*

If you have not done so already, please be sure to email me your documentation/proposal link along with a link to your HW repo.

#HW - Begin building out your midterm site.

Start by building out a functional wireframe with HTML and CSS. If you are still struggling with layout concepts such as block float and inline-block, next weeks tutorial on 996 Grid Framework will be helpful. You can review class notes on this [here](../Week_6/996_Grid).
